# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard

🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis using Excel 🍕

I'm excited to share my latest data analysis project, where I explored pizza sales data using Microsoft Excel! This end-to-end project allowed me to showcase my skills in data cleaning, processing, visualization, and insight generation.

The journey began with data cleaning, where I removed duplicates and trimmed blank spaces to ensure data integrity. Next, I enriched the dataset by adding columns for order day and time, enabling deeper analysis of temporal patterns.

Pivoting to Excel, I leveraged its powerful analytical capabilities to create insightful visualizations. Through a series of stacked bar charts, line graphs, bar charts, and doughnut charts, I uncovered fascinating trends and patterns within the data.

Key Insights:

📆 Day Trend: Orders peaked on Fridays and Saturdays, highlighting the weekend demand surge.

🕰️ Hour Trend: Peak order times were at 12 noon and 6 PM, aligning with lunchtime and dinnertime rushes.

🥗 Pizza Sold by Category: Veggie pizzas, particularly the Supreme variety, dominated sales.

🍕 Pizza Sold by Size: Large pizzas were the customer favorite, followed by medium sizes.

🏆 Top-Selling Pizza: The Classic Deluxe pizza reigned supreme with 2,453 overall orders.

🔴 Least-Selling Pizza: The Brie Carre pizza struggled to gain traction among customers.

To bring these insights together, I crafted an interactive dashboard consolidating all visualizations. With the addition of a timeline filter, users can seamlessly explore sales patterns across different time periods.
